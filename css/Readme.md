Rules: 
We'd like for you to create a responsive version of Zen Garden using HTML5 and
CSS3, and because we're assessing how you would approach this problem, we would
ask that you don't make direct use of frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation or
Skeleton.

It doesn't have to be pretty, but since it's a fairly simple page of content, we'd like to see it break down for tablet as well as mobile. Youâ€™ll get extra points for:
Comments
Performance enhancements
Attached link to Figma design file
Use of interesting CSS selectors
