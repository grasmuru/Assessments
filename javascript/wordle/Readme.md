Look at the basic wordle implementation provided

Two developers have a dispute as to who is a better wordle player and like to up the wordle requirements to compare their skills better

Modify the existing attached wordle code to: 

1) Start off with 8 lines of attempts to start off with.
2) As soon as the player enters the first word, make one line disappear every 30s
3) If the user runs out of lines before the end of the game, the game ends and the player loses
